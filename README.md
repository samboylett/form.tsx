# Formeum

A different type of form library - built from the ground up for performance, usability, and to put power in the developers hands. Unlike other context based form libraries, it is also strictly typed using Typescript.

This is a monorepo for all the official Formeum packages, [check out the core readme](packages/core/README.md) for usage details.
